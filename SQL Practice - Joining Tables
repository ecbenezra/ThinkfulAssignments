-- 1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

WITH rainy 
AS (
	SELECT 
		DATE(date) rain_date
	From 
		weather
	WHERE events = 'Rain'
	GROUP BY 1
) 
SELECT
	t.trip_id,
	t.duration,
	DATE(t.start_date)
FROM 
	trips t
JOIN 
	rainy r
on 
	DATE(t.start_date) = r.rain_date
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3

-- 2. Which station is full most often?

SELECT

  stations.name,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN docks_available=0 then 1 END) empty_count
FROM 
  status
JOIN 
  stations
ON  
  stations.station_id = status.station_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY empty_count DESC

-- 3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT

  dockcount,
  COUNT(*)
FROM 
  trips
JOIN

GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC

-- 4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
