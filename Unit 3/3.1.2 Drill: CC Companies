Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

I'm not sure how to use this to determine if someone is going to pay their bills on time, but we could look at spending over a month and try and see where it was categorized. KNN works best with continuous variables, which in this case is amount spent on any of the four categories. The categories themselves are categorical variables and therefore not terribly suited to KNN. However if we had another continuous variable, such as monthly incomes or bill payments, we might be able to get a better idea on some data using KNN.

Say we were trying to categorize if money was being spent on 'necessities' or 'frivolities'. We could assign 1 to groceries and utilities (necessities) and 0 to fun activities (dining out, entertainment). Our training data could look at different price points for groceries as well as, for example, total account balance for the holder. We normalize this information using the min and max of the account holder's balance and assign a numerical value between 0 and 1. 

Then, theoretically, we could feed in info and our algorithm could tell us if the transaction was likely out of need or for fun.
